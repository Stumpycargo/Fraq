        <div class="step">
          <div class="circle">1</div>
          <h3>We discover high-potential collectibles</h3>
          <p>Our expert team uses data analytics and a strong network of local collectors, dealers, and appraisers to identify rare and valuable collectibles—like vintage Bollywood posters, cricket memorabilia, limited-edition artworks, or heritage jewellery. Each asset is thoroughly authenticated before being selected for investment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="circle">2</div>
          <h3>We take care of your asset</h3>
          <p>Once acquired, we handle all aspects of storage, insurance, and maintenance of the collectible. Assets are stored securely in trusted facilities across India, using decentralised locations in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru to ensure safety and preservation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="circle">3</div>
          <h3>You invest in fractional ownership</h3>
          <p>Through the GoFraq app, you can invest in curated collectibles starting from as little as ₹4,500 per fraction. New assets are added weekly, and you can also opt into a monthly SIP-style plan to gradually build your portfolio while participating in the asset’s appreciation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="circle">4</div>
          <h3>You trade with fellow investors</h3>
          <p>While the average holding period is 2–8 years, you can choose to trade your investment fractions anytime via our secondary marketplace. Buy or sell fractions from other Indian investors based on your goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="circle">5</div>
          <h3>We sell the collectible</h3>
          <p>Our team continuously monitors market trends in India and globally to determine the best time to sell. Once a strong purchase offer is received, we seek approval from all fraction holders. If the majority agrees, we proceed with the sale and distribute the returns.</p>
